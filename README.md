# For the Love of Music

In this project, I used a digital music store database (which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers) to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.

Objective: The Music Store would like to open another store in the United States. They also like to target their inventories according to what can make them the most money. As a result, they need to analyze the data they've been gather throughout the years between 2009 - 2013 and see what types of music they should sell in their newest location
